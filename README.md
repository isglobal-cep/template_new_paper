# Template for a new paper

This repository serves as a template for each new paper/study. It is also supposed to serve as a `submodule` to be added to the main repository for my PhD (from now on I will refer to it simply as `main`). To do that:
1. Add this repository in the directory containing all the submodules (one for each paper) in `main` with `git submodule add template_new_paper`;
2. Commit the changes with `git commit -m "Added submodule for paper X"`;
3. Push the newly added submodule with `git push`.
